        <h4>Idea creating the project</h4>
        <p>
          Lecturers at school submit their weekly reports to supervisors using Forms. It involved too much manual work, 
          involved using multiple platforms just to fill in their weekly reports and submit them.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The Lecturers' Report System was designed to streamline the process of creating, managing, and submitting 
          reports for academic staff. The goal was to reduce paperwork, minimize errors, and provide a centralized 
          digital platform for all reporting needs.

        <h4>My role in the project</h4>
        <p>
          I was a back-end developer for this project. Working alongside a team of skilled front-end and back-end developers.
          I created multiple back-end methods to simplify processes, make the application fast, efficient, responsive, and
          scabalable. It was a pretty exciting adventure for me, learning and familiarizing myself with C#, and I must say 
          it's a pretty fun language to code in, and I am planning on using it for other projects next too.
